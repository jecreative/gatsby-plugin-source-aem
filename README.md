## ‚ö†Ô∏è Union Types Limitation

Currently, union types work only with content fragments that have a prefix of "Component" in their name. For example, a
valid content fragment name would be `Component: Hero`. This limitation applies specifically to union types, and
improvements are welcome.

Union types will only apply to those prefixed with "Component," which can then be referenced as a `unionType` in the
`schema.graphql` files like this:

```graphql
type Model implements Node {
  components: [Components]!
}
```
